# Pisek's Craftable Bell

Yet another data pack by Pisek *(me)*. This time I added a crafting recipe for Bells. In vanilla, they can be only found in villages or be bought from villagers, even though it's possible to think of some recipes, so I thought of one. This recipe will not make sense if you're planning to place the bell on a wall or hung it from the ceiling - the stone from the recipe will disappear, but without it, it would be cheaper which I found less challenging.
